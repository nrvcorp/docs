Our DVS-FMC board is a specialized hardware component used in FPGA-based systems, particularly for handling MIPI signals. The board's pinmap refers to the mapping of its pins to the various signals and functionalities it supports. This includes connections for MIPI data, clock signals, reset, and possibly GPIO(General-Purpose Input/Output) for custom user functions. Understanding the pinmap is crucial for integrating the DVS-FMC board into a larger system, as it dictates how the board interfaces with the FPGA and other components, ensuring proper signal flow and operation.
