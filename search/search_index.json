The board's pinmap refers to the mapping of its pins to the various signals and functionalities it supports. This includes connections for MIPI data, clock signals, reset, and possibly GPIO(General-Purpose Input/Output) for custom user functions. Understanding the pinmap is crucial for integrating the DVS-FMC board into a larger system, as it dictates how the board interfaces with the FPGA and other components, ensuring proper signal flow and operation.
