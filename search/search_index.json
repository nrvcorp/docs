Download host code from our GitHub page ( https://github.com/nrvcorp/dvs_sensor ). Here are some reference materials you might find useful: - View our DVS-MIPI Register Setfile from here . - View our DVS-FMC Board Pinmap from here . - View AER Packet Format from here . Steps to Operate DVS Camera 1) The distributed SD Card will contain a boot image (BOOT.BIN) 2) Power off the host PC and ZCU106, then insert the SD card. 3) Set the boot mode switch SW6 to ON-OFF-OFF-OFF to SD boot mode as shown in the following figure. 4) Connect the DVS Camera into HPC0 port. 5) Turn on the host PC and ZCU106 board. 6) Once the host PC is fully powered on, press the SW19 GPIO pin on the ZCU106 board. 7) Run host code on the PC.
